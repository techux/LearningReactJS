# Simple Form Handling
In this project, I explore the process of handling forms in React, focusing on how to collect user input, manage it with the useState hook, and perform actions like submitting and clearing the form. The goal is to understand how to bind form elements to state, track changes, and reset inputs effectively after submission.


# Tech Used
- ReactJS
- HTML/CSS

# Key Learning
- State management using useState hook
- Handling form events, particularly onSubmit and onChange, to trigger actions like form submission and input clearing
